## [1.1.0](https://github.com/sgl0v/MSRangeSlider/releases/tag/1.1.0)
Released on 2016-04-11. 

#### Updates
- Expanded the thumb touchable area. People experienced some difficulty with the thumb sliders being hard to drag. I noticed that in UISlider the thumb touchable area is expanded (just run the app with UIViewShowAlignmentRects=YES). Eventually I decided to implement the UIControl category to expand the thumb touchable area by 7.5pt from each side.
